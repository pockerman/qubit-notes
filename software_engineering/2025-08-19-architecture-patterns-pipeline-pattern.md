# qubit-note: Architecture Patterns-Pipeline Pattern

## Overview

The pipeline pattern or pipe-and-filter pattern, is an architectural pattern particularly prevalent to
data analysis applications. In this qubit note, I briefly review it.

## Pipeline pattern

Pipeline design pattern facilitates data processing across discrete stages, enhancing modular development and operational efficiency.
It comes with other names also [1]:

- Chain of operations
- Processing pipeline

In the pipeline pattern at each stage or filter the data is somehow altered and then passed to the next stage.
Extract-Transform-Load applications heavily utilize the pipeline pattern.

According to Wikipedia:

_In software engineering, a pipeline consists of a chain of processing elements (processes, threads, coroutines, functions, etc.), arranged so that the output of each element is the input of the next; the name is by analogy to a physical pipeline._

Thus, two stages may be executed on the same or different processing elements.

The pipeline pattern offers the following advanatges [1]:

- Decoupling
- Reusability
- Extensibility
- Scalability

Stages are independent to one another having to only abide to the input and output schema. This allows us to have a  system that is more modular and easier to maintain.
It also enhances reusability as stages can be reused in a different pipeline. It is also fairly easy to add new stages if needed.
As mentioned above a stage may run on its own processor, hence enhancing the scalability of a system.

It also has the following trade-offs:

- Complexity
- Performance overhead
- Debugging difficulty

A pipeline can exhibit a performance ovehead particualrly when the number of stages in large and/or the data movement is significant.
For pipelines that constantly perform read/write operations on the hard-disk it may be difficult to scale. In addition,
given that the pattern involves a number of stages, as this number increases the complexity of the system increases.
Although the pipeline pattern enhances separation of concerns and thus increases maintenability, it may not be easy to
debug a pipeline as the data goes over a number of stages.


## Summary

The pipeline (or pipe-and-filter) pattern is an architectural approach widely used in data analysis and ETL applications, where data flows through a sequence of stages, each transforming the input before passing it to the next. This design promotes modularity, reusability, extensibility, and scalability, since stages operate independently and can run on separate processors. However, it also introduces challenges such as increased complexity, performance overhead from data movement, and difficulty in debugging across multiple stages. Despite these trade-offs, the pattern remains a powerful method for building flexible and maintainable systems.
