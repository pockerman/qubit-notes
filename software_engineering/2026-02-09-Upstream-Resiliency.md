# qubit-note: Distributed Systems Series | Resiliency Part 3 | Upstream Resiliency

## Overview

<a href="2026-02-04-Downstream-Resiliency.md">qubit-note: Distributed Systems Series | Resiliency Part 2 | Downstream Resiliency</a>
discussed various options we can employ in order to handle downstream failures i.e. failures that are caused due to a failed
interaction with another service.

In this note, we want to look into how to handle failures within our system e.g. when our server is overloaded. Specifically,
we will look into:

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_shedding">Load shedding</a>
- Load leveling
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting">Rate limiting</a>
- Bulkhead
- Health check
- Watchdog
