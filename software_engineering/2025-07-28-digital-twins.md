# qubit-note: Digital Twins

## Overview

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber%E2%80%93physical_system">Cyberphysical systems</a> become increasingly complex. Therefore, it would have been ideal if we were able to
simulate their behaviour, performance and condition in real-time. This is the core idea behind digital twins.

## Digital Twins

According to wikipedia, [1]:

_A digital twin is a digital model of an intended or actual real-world physical product, system, or process (a physical twin) that serves as a digital counterpart of it for purposes such as simulation, integration, testing, monitoring, and maintenance_.


Thus, a digital twin is a virtual model of a real-world system, asset, or process. It’s not just a 3D simulation; it’s connected to the real thing, constantly updated with data from sensors, devices, or manual input. Think of it like this: if a jet engine has sensors measuring temperature, pressure, and vibration, all of that data feeds into its digital twin. Engineers can then monitor, test, or even predict failures. And all that without touching the physical engine.

Digital twins rely on several key technologies:

- IoT (Internet of Things): Connects physical objects to the cloud via sensors.
- Data analytics & AI: Helps make sense of the data and predict future behavior.
- 3D modeling & simulations: Visualizes how the system behaves or evolves.

The power of digital twins lies in prediction and optimization. Instead of reacting to problems, organizations can foresee issues, run virtual experiments, and make smarter decisions.
Hence, saving time, money, and sometimes even lives. Digital twins have many real-wrold applications such as:

- Manufacturing: Monitor factory equipment to reduce downtime.
- Healthcare: Simulate how a patient's body might respond to a treatment.
- Urban planning: Optimize traffic flow or energy usage using digital twins of cities.
- Aerospace & automotive: Predict component failures before they happen.

Digital twins however come with some disadvantges such as:

- Integration complexity
- High upfront costs
- Interoperability issues


## Summary

In summary, digital twins have the potential to  reshape how we interact with the physical world. As data becomes more accessible and computing more powerful, expect to see digital twins behind smarter cities, greener industries, and more personalized healthcare.
