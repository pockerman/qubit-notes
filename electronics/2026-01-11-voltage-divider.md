## Voltage Divider

According to [1]:

_In electronics, a voltage divider (also known as a potential divider) is a passive linear circuit that produces an output voltage (Vout) that is a fraction of its input voltage (Vin). Voltage division is the result of distributing the input voltage among the components of the divider. A simple example of a voltage divider is two resistors connected in series, with the input voltage applied across the resistor pair and the output voltage emerging from the connection between them._


What about the choice of resistor values? For a voltage divider, the most important part of
the resistor value's choices is their relative ratios to divide the voltage in a way we want.
Beyond that, it comes down to current flow and resistor power ratings – again, these are
applications of Ohm's Law and power.
