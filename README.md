# qubit-notes

Hello and welcome to my personal notes. This is a series of notes that I maintain around a number of topics not necessarilly related
to each other. These notes are just notes i.e. do not necessarilly go in depth or covering a topic exhaustively. 
The main idea behind these notes is to give the gist of a topic and provide references for further more in depth research.
