# qubit-note: Distributed Systems Series | Part 1 | Introduction to Distributed Systems

## Overview

In these series of notes we will disucss how to design distributed software systems
Specifically, we will disucss the fundamental challenges that have to be addressed in order to build and operate
distributed systems.


## Introduction

Before embarking on the journey of distributed system design let's first try to answer the question what is a distributed system.
There are plenty of definitions. Below is one that is attributed to Leslie Lamport [1]:


_A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unsuable._


Perhaps the most widedly know distributed system is the internet. Another example of a distributed system is, or can be, depending
on the needs, as web application. Since this is a very common example of a distributed system, we will use it as the driving example of these notes.
Specifically, we will start with a set up where everything we need can be hosted on one server and then throughout these notes we will discuss challenges
we need to address and techniques we can use to solve these challenges in order to scale our system to millions of users.




### Challenges of distributed system design


These challenges evolve around the folowing topics:

- Communication
- Coordination
- Scalability
- Resiliency
- Operations
